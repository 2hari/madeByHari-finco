### CSS

- fixing responsive layouts
- grid is better than flex for reponsive layouts
- using daisyUI sidebar
- custom breakpoints tailwind theme

### General

- even while building demos - having @apply classnames, default styles for h1,h2,h3 ... and usng dummy data + map instead of repeating markup is really nice and saves a lot of time in updating
